Online Reservation System, 
this application is built entirely in Java and simulates the end-to-end booking process using three core, modular components:

Login Module: Secure user authentication using in-memory credentials.

Reservation System: Captures passenger details, features automated train name lookups, and generates a unique 8-digit PNR for every booking.

Cancellation Form: Allows users to easily search, verify, and confirm the cancellation of tickets using their PNR number.

Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used custom User and Ticket classes for structured data.

Data Structures: Leveraged ArrayList and HashMap for data persistence (in-memory simulation).

Robustness: Implemented try-catch blocks for effective error handling and input validation.
